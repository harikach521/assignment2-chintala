###### Araku Valley

**Araku Valley** is a hill station and valley region in the southeastern Indian state of *Andhra Pradesh*. It's surrounded by the thick forests of the Eastern Ghats mountain range. The **Tribal Museum** is dedicated to the area's numerous indigenous tribes, known for their traditional **Dhimsa dance**, and showcases traditional handicrafts. A miniature train runs through Padmapuram Gardens, with its sculptures and tree-top huts.

I like it because as it is a hill station there are clouds where we can feel to touch and the  location is completely eye catchy.
